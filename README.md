Java Library System
This repository contains the Java Library System, a project developed to manage library operations, including books, patrons, and loans. It features a well-organized architecture with modular components for commands, data handling, graphical user interface (GUI), and testing.

üìã Project Overview
Purpose:
To implement a library management system using Java, showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, modular design, and GUI implementation. The project handles common library operations like managing books, patrons, and loans.

Features:

Add, update, and remove books, patrons, and loans.
Search for books and patrons.
GUI for easy interaction with the library system.
Persistent data storage using books.txt, loans.txt, and patrons.txt.
üìÇ File Structure

üîß How to Run
Clone the repository.
Open the project in an IDE:
Import the project into Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or another Java IDE.
Ensure the classpath and project settings are configured correctly.
Compile and run:
Locate the main package in src/bcu/cmp5332/librarysystem/main.
Run the Main.java file to start the application.
üåü Features in Detail
Book Management:
Add, update, search, and remove books in the library.
Patron Management:
Manage library patrons, including adding, updating, and searching patrons.
Loan Management:
Record loans, return books, and manage overdue items.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
Intuitive interface for managing library operations.
Persistent Data Storage:
Data is stored and retrieved from books.txt, loans.txt, and patrons.txt.
üìö Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language.
Swing or JavaFX (GUI): For graphical user interface implementation.
JUnit: For unit testing.
üõ†Ô∏è Development and Testing
The test/ folder contains unit tests to ensure system reliability.
Use JUnit (or the testing framework specified in your IDE) to run the test cases.
